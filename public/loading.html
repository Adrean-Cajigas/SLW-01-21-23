      We strive to integrate life experiences with academia to promote educational success and 
      personal growth by granting students the opportunity to connect with their local community and beyond. 
      By developing a deeper connection with Modesto Junior College, students can further 
      their education by understanding the purpose and application of knowledge gained from a 
      classroom to the real world. Watch our video to learn more about our team!
